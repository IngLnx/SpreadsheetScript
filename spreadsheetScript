.TH SPREADSHEETSCRIPT 1 "18th July, 2013" "Version 1.0"
.SH NAME
spreadsheetScript.py \- Accesses and edits google spreadsheets in your google drive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpython spreadsheetScript.py --user\fP \fIemail\fP \fB--pwd\fP \fIpassword\fP [OPTIONS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
spreadsheetScrip.py is a python program that accesses google spreadsheets in a google drive and performs some actions on them.
To start with you have to define your email and password so we can access your google drive. This program only accesses spreadsheets and nothing else. It performs actions on these spreadsheets based on the arguments you give it. The program can be used both on the command line and in an interactive simulation of a python shell...because the program is cool like that. Not that the interactive part of the program only works when the \fB--exit\fP option is not specified with the terminal command. When issuing the command you have to use either the \fB--docName\fP or \fB--nSS\fP so we know which spreadsheet you want to work with

This inserts the value \fIval\fP into the cell with coordinates row \fI2\fP, column \fI3\fP in the first worksheet of the spreadsheet \fIdocument_name\fP and goes into the interactive part of the program. To avoid the interactive part, add \fB--exit\fP to the commands. To insert into more than one cell at a time, separate with a semi-colon (;). Tpye \fB--iCellVal\fP \fI2,2,A;3,3,B;4,4,C;\fP
.TP
\fB python spreadsheetScript.py --user\fP \fIemail\fP \fB--pwd\fP \fIpassword\fP \fB--nSS\fP \fITest\fP \fB--iRowVal\fP \fI2,A,B,C;3,D,E,F,G,H\fP
Creates a new worksheet called \fITest\fP and inserts \fIA,B,C\fP and \fID,E,F,G,H\fP into rows \fI2\fP and \fI3\fP respectively. To insert into just one row at a time type \fB--iRowVal\fP \fI2,A,B,C\fP
.SH NOTES
.TP
* All commands irrespective of the order typed in, are executed in the following order: new(n) or creating, insertions(i), deletions(d), other commands(print, help) and then exit
.TP
* When issuing the command you have to use either \fB--docName\fP or \fB--nSS\fP. You can use both. However, \fB--docName\fP has precedence over \fB--nSS\fP
.TP
* To avoid the interactive part of the program add \fB--exit\fP to the command arguments
